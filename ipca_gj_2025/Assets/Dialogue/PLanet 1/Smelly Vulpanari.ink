(A tall, alcohol-infused Vulparis sits in the shadows of the canteen, his fur a darker shade of amber. His eyes are sharp, constantly scanning the room. When you approach, he gives a slight nod—the barest flicker of recognition.) #speaker:Smelly Vulparnari

You’ve got questions about Crustalune, do you? Interesting.

+ Crustalune’s been a pain lately. What’s the word from Vulparis? What do we know about it?
    (He tilts his head, already tired of hearing about Crustalune.)
    Crustalune, huh? Always people looking to slip past the Tide and bribes. But you're talking to a Vulparis who knows better than to mess with a place like that.
    What you should be asking about is how we vanish into silence.
    You know the Whispering Cities?

    ++ Whispering Cities? Never heard of them. What are they?
        (He smirks faintly.)
        Hidden cities of Vulparis. Carved into salt caverns, buried deep. No orbital scan sees them.
        Shielded. Secret. Sacred.

        +++ Sounds like a hell of a place. So how do you even get to them?
            (He chuckles.)
            You don’t. Not unless someone lets you. And even then, good luck finding your way back out.
            Entrances are hidden—sand-swallowed or sealed beneath the crust.

        +++ What’s so special about those cities? What makes them so well-protected?
            (He leans in, whispering.)
            We built them to be forgotten. We survive by staying unseen. That’s Vulparis.
            -> booze

    ++ I don’t need cities, I need to get cargo past Crustalune’s scans.
        (He raises a brow.)
        Everyone wants to outsmart Crustalune. But real stealth isn’t slipping past—they see that.
        Real stealth is not being seen at all. That’s Vulparis silence.
        -> booze

+ So you’re saying Crustalune’s nothing compared to what Vulparis can hide?
    (His expression hardens.)
    Crustalune's an open book. We’re a sealed vault.
    You can buy your way through their ports, bribe the guards, pay off the officials.
    But us? No credits get you in. Only trust.

    ++ I see. And what happens if someone does get in? What’s in those cities?
        (He shrugs slowly.)
        Old tech. History. Survival. And silence.
        But if you have to ask, maybe you don’t need to know.
        -> booze

    ++ You’re not giving me much. What’s the point if you’re not helping with Crustalune?
        (His gaze sharpens.)
        You want help? Ask someone who plays by their rules.
        I don’t deal in open-air politics.

So kid, I’m getting bored. Let me enjoy my drink in peace, yeah?
